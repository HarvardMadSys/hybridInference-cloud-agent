"""Port: repository authorization and the GitLab credentials behind it.

Repo grants, OAuth state, and the stored GitLab connection. Declared here
because the publishing path needs it without the whole store.

Declared here, beside the code that calls it, so a caller depends on the
operations it needs rather than on the whole persistence surface.
