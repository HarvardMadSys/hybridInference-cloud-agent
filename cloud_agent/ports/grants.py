        Fenced like every other worker write: an attempt that was superseded
        between the claim and this call does not get the grant recorded against
        it, so the renewal pass never picks it up and the capability dies at its
        own TTL.

        **The same three predicates as ``list_renewable_grants``, deliberately.**
        That query is the fence, and this write is what puts a row inside it —
        so a row this accepts and that rejects is a grant nothing will ever
        renew, bound to an attempt whose lease another runner may already have
        taken. The expiry check was missing here while being present there,
        which is exactly the pair that produces two live sandboxes for one job:
        a lease can lapse between the claim and this call without the
        generation changing, because nothing bumps a generation on expiry
        alone.

        Args:
            attempt_id: The attempt the grant belongs to.
            lease_generation: The fence the claim returned.
            grant_id: The gateway's identifier for the grant.

        **This is the fence.** A renewal loop that skipped this query and
        renewed whatever it minted would keep a superseded attempt's sandbox
        alive and spending, and the gateway could not catch it — it has no
        attempt state to check. Every predicate here is load-bearing:
        ``status = 'running'`` drops superseded and finished attempts, and
        ``lease_expires_at > NOW()`` drops the ones whose lease died before the
        reaper noticed.

        ``lease_generation`` rides along because the renewal pass may have to
        *end* one of these attempts — a grant the gateway keeps refusing — and
        every write that ends an attempt is fenced. Looking the generation up
        again at that point would read a row that may have moved on in between.

        The complement of :meth:`list_renewable_grants`: a superseded attempt,
        a finished one, or one whose lease lapsed. Returning them and clearing
        the column in one statement is what stops two control-plane replicas —
        or two passes of the same loop — from both trying to revoke, and what
        stops a grant the gateway refuses to revoke from being retried forever.

        The clear is a data-modifying CTE rather than
        ``UPDATE ... RETURNING grant_id``, because ``RETURNING`` reports the
        **new** value — which is the ``NULL`` just written. That version passed
        every in-memory test and handed ``None`` to ``revoke`` against a real
        database; ``tests/integration/storage/test_agent_grant_store.py`` is
        what caught it.

        Clearing before the gateway has confirmed anything is deliberate.
        Revocation is an *acceleration* of the TTL, not the mechanism: the
        capability expires on its own, so a failed revoke costs lateness, and a
        row that kept being retried would cost a call every pass for as long as
        the deployment ran.
